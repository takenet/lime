                    <h3 id="what">What is it?</h3>
                    <p><strong>LIME Protocol</strong> (acronym for <em>Lightweight Messaging Protocol</em>) is a JSON based protocol for messaging, inspired by the XMPP protocol. It aims to be simple but extensible, with little verbosity but yet providing good readability.</p>
                    <h3 id="xmpp">And why not just use XMPP?</h3>
                    <p>XMPP is a protocol widely used for real-time communication but is complex due to the number of features and extensions that it implements. Just take a look at its <a href="http://xmpp.org/xmpp-protocols/xmpp-core/">specification</a> to understand that XMPP goes far beyond what LIME proposes.</p>
                    <p>This protocol defines only a basic message structure and makes use of the MIME content type declarations to remain extensible, but is not mean to cover all the scenarios that XMPP supports.</p>
                    <h1 id="definitions" class="anchor">Definitions</h1>
                    <h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
                    <p>The basic idea of the protocol is the exchange of JSON documents between elements in a network. These documents are called <strong>envelopes</strong> and the elements <strong>nodes</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The protocol defines four types of envelopes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#message">Message</a></strong> - Provides the transport of a content between nodes in a network.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#notification">Notification</a></strong> - Notify events related to a message.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#command">Command</a></strong> - Allows the manipulation of node resources, like server session parameters or information related to network nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><a href="#session">Session</a></strong> - Allows the configuration and establishment of the communication channel between nodes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The nodes communicate with each other over persistent connections, like TCP or Websockets. 
                        The protocol is asynchronous, so there's no guarantee of delivery order of the envelopes, except during the session negotiation, where only session envelopes are allowed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every connected node must have an identity, presented in the <em>name@domain</em> format, as defined by the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.4.1">RFC 2822, section 3.4.1</a>. 
                        The domain name should be a valid domain (i.e. can be resolved by a DNS server) and the name a valid user account identifier in the domain. 
                        The identity is authenticated by the server during the establishment of the session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the identity, the connected node can suggest a name to the particular connection using a identifier called <em>instance</em>. 
                        This identifier should appears after the identity, separated by a slash (/) symbol, during the session authentication process. 
                        One identity can have more than one active connection in a domain so the <em>instance</em> should be used to differentiate these connections. 
                        Usually is used the name of the device (John-Cellphone, John-PC) but can be any valid string. If not provided, the server will set a default value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Therewith, the complete format of a node identifier is <em>name@domain/instance</em>, similar to the <a href="http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc3920.html#rfc.section.3">XMPP's Jabber ID</a> 
                        (the difference is that the identifier located after the slash is called <em>instance</em> instead of <em>resource</em>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During a connection, there's a <strong>server</strong> which is the node that received the connection and the <strong>client</strong>, the node which started it.
                        The only difference between these roles is related to the session state management, where the server has full control of it. Besides that, they share the same set of functionality.
                        During the session establishment, the server provides an session id, its own node identifier and the client node identifier. It can optionally authenticate the client using an authentication scheme or provide an arbitrary node identifier without asking any information of the client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although both parties of a session knows each other's node identifier, they can receive and send envelopes with distinct node information of the remote party.
                        This means that a node can act as intermediate to be a envelopes switcher for nodes that are not directly connected. But it must be trusted by both sender and destination nodes for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance, in a session between <em>client@domain/instance</em> and <em>server@domain/instance</em> the first one can receive an envelope that the sender is <em>someone@domain/instance</em> in that session.
                        In this case, the client must decide if it trusts the remote party to send envelopes with that node identifier. Specifically, it should look if the remote party is trusted to originate envelopes in behalf of the specified node domain.
                        This trust should be built outside the protocol, using techniques like a DNS query to look for a SRV entry to connect in a specified domain and transport TLS authentication.
                        You can trust a remote party if the remote certificate is a valid <strong>domain certificate</strong>, emitted by a trusted issuer.
                        In the case of receiving an envelope addressed to a different node, the party that received it can forward to the destination, but only if it can directly reach it.
                        This means that the node must have a direct connection with that node or with a node that is trusted to receive this envelope, in the same conditions that are illustrated above.
                        And after the envelope has been forwarded, the actual envelope destination should decides if it trusts the remote party in the same way.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="envelope">Envelope</h3>
                    <p>The JSON documents exchanged in a LIME conversation are called envelopes. The JSON data must be compliant with the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627">RFC 4627</a> specification, using the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629">UTF-8</a> encoding.</p>
                    <p>Every envelope may contains the following properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>from</strong> - Identifier of the sender node of the envelope, in the <em>name@domain/instance</em> format. If a node receives an envelope without this value, it means that the envelope was originated by the remote party.                         
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>to</strong> - Identifier of the destination node of the envelope, in the same format of the sender. If a node receives an envelope without this value, it means that the envelope is addressed to itself.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>pp</strong> - Acronym for <em>per procurationem</em>. Identifier of a delegate node (a node that received a permission to send on behalf of another), in the <em>name@domain/instance</em> format. Allows a node to send an envelope on behalf of another identity. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>id</strong> - Unique identifier of the envelope, in the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt">UUID</a> format. 
                            The purpose of using a 128-bit identifier is minimize the risk of a collision, since the protocol allows interconnections between networks in different domains, each one with a large number of connected nodes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>metadata</strong> - Allows the transport of generic information, in the "name": "value" format. This property is optional for all envelopes. Any value set in this property should not change the behavior of the server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            <strong>to</strong> - Mandatory for the sender, but is allowed to ommit the value of the <em>instance</em> (the server will route the envelope according to the routing rule chosen by the destination) and/or <em>domain</em> (the server will assume that the destination is in the same domain of the sender) properties. optional in the destination.

                            For structured data, is recommended to use JSON subtypes (like <em>application/json</em> or <em>application/vnd.specific+json</em>), althought is possible to send other types, like XML, provided that the unsupported characters in content are escaped, accordinally to the JSON specification.
                            The protocol defines some <a href="content-types.html">common types</a> that should be reused. 
                            If you are using a custom content type, consider <a href="http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/mediatypes.pl">registering it</a> with IANA in order to provide interoperability.

                            <strong>pp</strong> - Optional. This property is useful to get resources in the server owned by different identities, like presence and account information. The value should be defined if the resource of an <em>observe</em> method command is owned by a different identity than the destination.
                        </li>

                                    <strong>observe</strong> - Notify the destination about a change in the resource value of the sender. Commands with this method are one-way and the destination should not send a response for it. Because of that, these commands may not have an <em>id</em>.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            The supported scheme is <em>lime</em>, and the authority must be always the identity of the resource owner. In command requests, this identity is always the same of the identity of <em>from</em> envelope property.
                            Since the base URI is always the same for a specific identity (<em>lime://user@domain</em>), the URI can be represented as a fragment, like <em>/groups</em>, instead of <em>lime://user@domain/groups</em>.
                            The URI may als contains a query string for filtering.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>type</strong> - MIME type of the resource. Like the messages, the protocol defines some <a href="resources.html">common resource types</a>, but may exists specific resources to the implementation. This property should be present always when the value of <em>resource</em> property is defined.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>resource</strong> - JSON representation of the resource. It must be present in commands with the methods <em>set</em> and <em>observe</em> and may be present in the method <em>delete</em>.
                            In a command response, must be present in successfully processed command with the method <em>get</em>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition of the above, the command response may contains the following properties:</p>

                    <p>In a session, the following constraints should apply to the envelope properties:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>id</strong> - Mandatory, except in the first request sent by the client (<em>new</em> state). This value is generated by the server in the first session envelope sent to the client.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>from</strong> - Mandatory for the client during the session authentication. Otherwise, is optional. The client may ommit the <em>instance</em> value. In this case, the server will define a default instance value.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>to</strong> - Optional.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>pp</strong> - Not applicable.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>metadata</strong> - The server should ignore any value set in this property by the client but it can use this property to send statistics about itself (serverVersion, lastConnectionDate, and so) to the client.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Besides envelope properties, a session may contains:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>state</strong> - Informs or changes the state of a session. Only the server can change the session state, but the client can request the state transition. The valid values are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>new</strong> - The session is new and doesn't exists an established context. It is sent by a client node to start a session with a server.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>negotiating</strong> - The server and the client are negotiating the session options, like cryptography and compression. The server sends to the client the options (if available) and the client chooses the desired options.
                                    If there's no options (for instance, if the connection is already encrypted or the transport protocol doesn't support these options), the server should skip the negotiation.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    The authentication can occurs in multiple roundtrips, according to the selected schema.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>established</strong> - The session is active and is possible to send and receive messages and commands. The server sends this state after the session was authenticated.

                                <li>
                                    <strong>finishing</strong> - The client node is requesting to the server to finish the session.
                                </li>
                                <li>
